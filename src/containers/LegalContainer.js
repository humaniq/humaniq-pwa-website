Our security documents help ensure that Humaniq customers can rely on our workers to behave ethically and for our service to operate securely. Security documents include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li> Fair, ethical, and legal standards of business conduct</li> <li> Acceptable uses of information systems</li> <li> Classification, labeling, and handling rules for all types of information assets</li> <li> Practices for worker identi cation, authentication, and authorization for access to system data</li> <li> Secure development, acquisition, con guration, and maintenance of systems</li> <li> Workforce requirements for transitions, training, and compliance with ISMS policies</li> <li> Use of encryption</li> <li> Description, schedule, and requirements for retention of security records</li> <li> Planning for business continuity and disaster recovery</li> <li> Classification and management of security incidents</li> <li> Control of changes</li> <li> Regular use of security assessments such as risk assessments, audits, and penetration tests</li> <li> Use of service organizations</li> </ul> <p>These policies are living documents: they are regularly reviewed and updated as needed, and made available to all workers to whom they apply.</p> <h3>Audits</h3> <p>Humaniq evaluates the design and operation of its overall ISMS for compliance with internal and external standards. Humaniq engages certified assessors to perform external audits at least once per year. Audit results are shared with senior management and all findings are tracked to resolution. </p> <h3>Penetration testing</h3> <p>Humaniq engages independent entities to conduct regular application-level and infrastructure-level penetration tests. Results of these tests are shared with Humaniq management. Humaniq’s Security Team reviews and prioritizes the reported findings and tracks them to resolution. Customers wishing to conduct their own penetration test of Humaniq application may request to do so and should contact their account representative to obtain permission from both Humaniq and Humaniq’s hosting provider. </p> <h3>Legal compliance</h3> <p>Humaniq operates a comprehensive information security programme designed to address the vast majority of the requirements of common security standards. Please contact Humaniq Support, for more information about the security standards with which Humaniq complies and to request copies of available reports and certifications.</p> <h2>Secure by design</h2> <p>Humaniq operates a comprehensive information security programme designed to address the vast majority of the requirements of common security standards. Please contact Humaniq Support, for more information about the security standards with which Humaniq complies and to request copies of available reports and certifications.</p> <h3>SDL</h3> <p>Humaniq assesses the security risk of each software development project according to our Secure Development Lifecycle. Before completion of the design phase, Humaniq undertakes an assessment to qualify the security risk of the software changes introduced. This risk analysis leverages both the OWASP Top 10 and the experience of Humaniq’s Product Security team to categorize every project as High, Medium, or Low risk. Based on this analysis, Humaniq creates a set of requirements that must be met before the resulting change may be released to production.</p> <h2>Protecting customer data</h2> <p>The focus of Humaniq’s security programme is to prevent unauthorized access to customer data. To this end, our team of dedicated security practitioners, working in partnership with peers across all our teams, take exhaustive steps to identify and mitigate risks, implement best practices, and constantly evaluate ways to improve.</p> <h3>Data encryption in transit and at rest </h3> <p>Humaniq transmits data over public networks using strong encryption. This includes data transmitted between Humaniq clients and the Humaniq service. Humaniq supports the latest recommended secure cipher suites to encrypt all traf c in transit, including use of TLS 1.2 protocols, AES256 encryption, and SHA2 signatures, as supported by the clients. Humaniq monitors the changing cryptographic landscape and upgrades the cipher suite choices as the landscape changes, while also balancing the need for compatibility with older clients.</p> <p>Data at rest in Humaniq’s production network is encrypted using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption standards. This applies to all types of data at rest within Humaniq’s systems—relational databases, le stores, database backups, etc. Humaniq stores encryption keys in a secure server on a segregated network with very limited access. Keys are never stored on the local lesystem, but are delivered at process start time and retained only in memory while in use.</p> <p>The Humaniq service is hosted in data centres maintained by industry-leading service providers. Data center providers offer state-of-the-art physical protection for the servers and related infrastructure that comprise the operating environment for the Humaniq service. These service providers are responsible for restricting physical access to Humaniq’s systems to authorized personnel.</p> <p>Each Humaniq customer’s data is hosted in Humaniq’s shared infrastructure and segregated logically by the Humaniq application. Humaniq uses a combination of storage technologies to ensure customer data is protected from hardware failures and returns quickly when requested. Network security</p> <p>Humaniq divides its systems into separate networks to better protect more sensitive data. Systems supporting testing and development activities are hosted in a separate network from systems supporting Humaniq’s production website. Customer data submitted into the Humaniq services is only permitted to exist in Humaniq’s production network, its most tightly controlled network. Administrative access to systems within the production network is limited to those engineers with a speci c business need.</p> <p>Network access to Humaniq’s production environment from open, public networks (the internet) is restricted. Only a small number of production servers are accessible from the internet. Only those network protocols essential for delivery of Humaniq’s service to its users are open at Humaniq’s perimeter. Humaniq deploys mitigations against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at its network perimeter. Changes to Humaniq’s production network con guration are restricted to authorized personnel.</p> <p>In Humaniq’s hosted production environment, control of network devices is retained by the hosting provider. For that reason, Intrusion Detection / Intrusion Prevention (IDS/IPS) are performed using host-based controls. For example, Humaniq logs, monitors, and audits system calls and has developed alerts for system calls that indicate a potential intrusion. Authorizing access</p> <p>To minimize the risk of data exposure, Humaniq adheres to the principle of least privilege—workers are only authorized to access data that they reasonably must handle in order to ful ll their current job responsibilities. To ensure that users are so restricted, Humaniq employs the following measures:</p> <ul> <li>All systems used at Humaniq require users to authenticate, and users are granted unique identi ers for that purpose.</li> <li>Each user’s access is reviewed at least quarterly to ensure the access granted is still appropriate for the user’s current job responsibilities. Workers may be granted access to a small number of internal systems, such as the corporate Humaniq instance, by default upon hire. Requests for additional access follow a documented process and are approved by the responsible owner or manager.</li> </ul> <h3>Authentication</h3> <p>To further reduce the risk of unauthorized access to data, Humaniq employs multi-factor authentication for administrative access to systems with more highly classi ed data. Where possible and appropriate, Humaniq uses private keys for authentication. For example, at this time, administrative access to production servers requires operators to connect using both an SSH key and a one-time password associated with a device-specific token. Where passwords are used, multi-factor authentication is enabled for access to higher data classi cations. The passwords themselves are required to be complex (auto-generated to ensure uniqueness, longer than 12 characters, and not consisting of a single dictionary word, among other requirements). </p> <p>Humaniq requires personnel to use an approved password manager. Password managers generate, store and enter unique and complex passwords. Use of a password manager helps avoid password reuse, phishing, and other behaviors that can reduce security. </p> <h3>System monitoring, logging, and alerting</h3> <p> Humaniq monitors servers, workstations and mobile devices to retain and analyze a comprehensive view of the security state of its corporate and production infrastructure. Administrative access, use of privileged commands, and system calls on all servers in Humaniq’s production network are logged.</p> <p>Humaniq’s Security Team collects and stores production logs for analysis. Logs are stored in a separate network. Access to this network is restricted to members of the Security Team. Logs are protected from modi cation and retained for at least two years. Analysis of logs is automated to the extent practical to detect potential issues and alert responsible personnel. Alerts are examined and resolved based on documented priorities.</p> <h3>Endpoint monitoring</h3> <p>Humaniq workstations run a variety of monitoring tools that may detect suspicious code or unsafe con gurations or user behavior. Humaniq’s Security Team monitors workstation alerts and ensures significant issues are resolved in a timely fashion.</p> <h3>Responding to security incidents</h3> <p>Humaniq has established policies and procedures (also known as runbooks) for responding to potential security incidents. All incidents are managed by Humaniq’s dedicated Computer Security Incident Response Team. Humaniq de nes the types of events that must be managed via the incident response process. Incidents are classi ed by severity. Incident response procedures are tested and updated at least annually.</p> <h3>Workstation security</h3> <p>All workstations issued to workers are configured by Humaniq to comply with our standards for security. These standards require all workstations to be properly con gured, kept updated, run monitoring software, and be tracked by Humaniq&rsquo;s endpoint management solution. Humaniq&rsquo;s default configuration sets up workstations to encrypt data, have strong passwords, and lock when idle. Workstations run up-to-date monitoring software to report potential malware and unauthorized software and mobile storage devices.</p> <h2>Controlling system operations and continuous deployment</h2> <p>We take a variety of steps to combat the introduction of malicious or erroneous code to our operating environment and protect against unauthorized access.</p> <p>All members of Humaniq’s Security Team are active participants in the larger information security community to improve the overall state of the art of information security and to maintain their own expertise. </p> <h3>Policies and standards</h3> <p>Humaniq maintains a set of policies, standards, procedures and guidelines (“security documents”) that provide the Humaniq workforce with the “rules of the road” for operating Humaniq’s ISMS.

Incidents are classi ed by severity. Incident response procedures are tested and updated at least annually.</p> <h3>Workstation security</h3> <p>All workstations issued to workers are configured by Humaniq to comply with our standards for security. These standards require all workstations to be properly con gured, kept updated, run monitoring software, and be tracked by Humaniq&rsquo;s endpoint management solution. Humaniq&rsquo;s default configuration sets up workstations to encrypt data, have strong passwords, and lock when idle. Workstations run up-to-date monitoring software to report potential malware and unauthorized software and mobile storage devices.</p> <h2>Controlling system operations and continuous deployment</h2> <p>We take a variety of steps to combat the introduction of malicious or erroneous code to our operating environment and protect against unauthorized access.</p> <h3>Controlling change</h3> <p>To minimize the risk of data exposure, Humaniq controls changes, especially changes to production systems, very carefully. Humaniq applies change control requirements to systems that store data at higher levels of sensitivity. These requirements are designed to ensure that changes potentially impacting Customer Data are documented, tested, and approved before deployment.</p> <h3>Prevention and detection of malicious code</h3> <p>In addition to general change control procedures that apply to our systems, Humaniq&rsquo;s production network is subject to additional safeguards against malware.</p> <h3>Server hardening</h3> <p>New servers deployed to production are hardened by disabling unneeded and potentially insecure services, removing default passwords, and applying Humaniq&rsquo;s custom configuration settings to each server before use.</p> <h3>File change management</h3><p>Humaniq maintains the con guration of its production servers by using a con guration management system (CMS) that runs frequently to check that only the authorized version of key les are deployed. This CMS will overwrite les found on servers that don&rsquo;t match the correct version stored in a change controlled repository.</p> <h2>Disaster recovery and business continuity</h2> <p>Humaniq utilizes services provided by its hosting provider to distribute its production operation across four separate physical locations. These four locations are within multiple geographic region, and protect Humaniq&rsquo;s service from loss of connectivity, power infrastructure and other common location-speci c failures. Production transactions are replicated among these discrete operating environments, to protect the availability of Humaniq&rsquo;s service in the event of a location-speci c catastrophic event. Humaniq also retains a full backup copy of production data in a remote location more than 2500 miles from the location of the primary operating environment. Full backups are saved to this remote location once per day and transactions are saved continuously. Humaniq tests backups at least quarterly to ensure they can be correctly restored.</p> <h2>3rd party suppliers</h2> <p>To run its business ef ciently, Humaniq relies on sub-service organizations. Where those sub-service organizations may impact the security of Humaniq&rsquo;s production environment, Humaniq takes appropriate steps to ensure its security posture is maintained. Humaniq establishes agreements that require service organizations adhere to con dentiality commitments Humaniq has made to its users. Humaniq monitors the effective operation of the organization&rsquo;s safeguards by conducting reviews of its service organization controls before use and at least annually.</p>"

HMQ IS NOT AN INVESTMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED AS AN INVESTMENT.</p> <p>Anyone purchasing or holding HMQ certifies that they are doing so out of a desire to use or consume HMQ on the Humaniq network, to participate in the Humaniq community and for the utility value of HMQ, and not for any speculative, investment or financial reasons.</p> <h2>Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol.</h2> <p>HMQ and the Humaniq network are based upon the Ethereum protocol. As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause the Humaniq network or HMQ to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum Protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to HMQ, and also other ways. More information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org. Humaniq takes no responsibility for outcomes on the Ethereum platform and acknowledges that any adverse outcomes on the Ethereum platform are outside of the direct or indirect control of Humaniq.</p> <h2>Risks Associated with Witnessing, Voting and Other Utility Uses on the Humaniq Network.</h2> <p>The coinholder may lose HMQ by carelessly or maliciously exercising any voting rights that may be associated with HMQ. Failing to vote as required by the Humaniq network may result in a loss of HMQ. Voting for an outcome that is in the minority of the recorded votes may result in a loss of HMQ. Coinholder understands that voting rights associated with HMQ must be exercised within the governing bounds of HMQ and the Humaniq project</p> <h2>Risks Associated with Coinholder Credentials. </h2> <p>Any third party that gains access to the coinholder&rsquo;s login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of the coinholder&rsquo;s HMQ. To minimize this risk, the coinholder should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices. Humaniq makes no representation that it will protect the coinholder&rsquo;s login credentials, and it is the duty of the coinholder to guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices, and Humaniq is in no way responsible for theft of login credentials as a result of the action of user</p> <h2>Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions.</h2> <p>Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Humaniq network and HMQ could be impacted by one or more regulatory enquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like HMQ, which could impede or limit the development of the Humaniq network. Competitive eSports and exchanges of value based on the outcomes of competitive eSports matches, the core business of the Company, have been, and will likely continue to be, the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The legal ability for the Company to operate the Humaniq network in some or all jurisdictions could be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event that it is not legal for the Humaniq network to operate in a jurisdiction, the Company will cease operations in that jurisdiction. There is a serious risk that the Company will be unable to operate if regulation makes it difficult to do so. Humaniq makes no representations that it has any special knowledge in terms of future regulatory actions by any jurisdiction globally, and makes no representation that these potential future regulatory actions will not adversely affect the value of the Humaniq network and HMQ.</p> <h2>Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Humaniq Networks.</h2> <p>Following the presale and the development of the initial version of the HMQ platform and Humaniq network, it is possible that alternative networks could be established, which utilize the same open source code and open source protocol underlying the Humaniq network. The official Humaniq network may compete with these alternative, unofficial HMQ-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Humaniq network and HMQ. Humaniq will make reasonable effort to generate alternative, unofficial Humaniq networks are not created, but makes no representation that this not occur due to circumstances outside of Humaniq&rsquo;s control.</p> <h2>Risk of Insufficient Interest in Humaniq and Distributed Applications.</h2> <p>It is possible that the Humaniq network will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Humaniq network and therefore the potential uses or value of HMQ. &nbsp;Humaniq will make reasonable effort to generate sufficient interest in the Humaniq Network and distributed applications, but makes no representation that this will certainly occur.</p> <h2>Risk that the Humaniq Network, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of the Coinholder.</h2> <p>The Humaniq network is presently under development and may undergo significant changes during development. Any expectations regarding the form and functionality of HMQ or the Humaniq network held by the coinholder may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the Humaniq network. Humaniq will make reasonable effort to assure that the Humaniq Network, as developed, will meet the expectations of the coinholder of HMQ, but makes no representation that this will certainly occur.</p> <h2>Risk of Theft and Hacking. </h2> <p>Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Humaniq network or the availability of HMQ in any number of ways, including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in executing and enhancing the cybersecurity of the Humaniq network and protect against theft and hacking attacks., but makes no representation that this will certainly occur.</p> <h2>Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography. </h2> <p>Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Humaniq platform, which could result in the theft or loss of HMQ. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in mitigating the risks posed by cryptographic advances and the development of quantum computing, but makes no representations that there will not be risk posed by these ad</p> <h2>Risk of Security Weaknesses in the HMQ network Core Infrastructure Software.</h2> <p>The Humaniq network consists of open-source software that is itself based on open-source software. There is a risk that the Humaniq team, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Humaniq network interfering with the use of or causing the loss of HMQ. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in correcting infrastructural weaknesses or bugs in the core infrastructural elements on the Humaniq network on a timely basis, but makes no representations that there will not be bugs or infrastructural weaknesses in the Humaniq network</p> <h2>Risk of HMQ Mining Attacks. </h2> <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Humaniq network is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &ldquo;selfish-mining&rdquo; attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Humaniq network, expected proper execution and sequencing of Humaniq markets, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Company, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in protecting against HMQ mining attacks, but makes no representations that mining attacks will not occur outside of the direct control of Humaniq.</p> <h2>Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Humaniq Network.</h2> <p>While HMQ should not be viewed as an investment, it may potentially (but likely will not) have value over time. That value may be limited if the Humaniq network lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the case, there may be few or no markets upon which to utilize HMQ, limiting the value of HMQ. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in driving mass adoption of the Humaniq Network via aggressive fundraising, marketing, public relations, and earned media campaigns, but makes no representations that mass adoption and use of the Humaniq network will occur.</p> <h2>Risk of Dissolution of the Humaniq Project.</h2> <p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons or risks, either disclosed or unforeseen, including without limitation, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether, Bitcoin, or other cryptographic and fiat currencies, unfavorable fluctuation in the value of HMQ, the failure of business relationships, the dissolution of partnerships, or competing intellectual property claims, the Humaniq network may no longer be a viable business and the Company may dissolve or the Humaniq network may fail to launch. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in ensuring that dissolution of the Humaniq Project does not occur, but makes no representations that losses will not occur as the result of circumstances outside of Humaniq&rsquo;s direct control.</p> <h2>Unanticipated Risks.</h2> <p>Cryptocurrency and cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth here, there are risks that the Company cannot anticipate. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth here. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in ensuring that all risks are mitigated, but makes no representations that all risks associated with the Humaniq network, HMQ, and other cryptocurrency concerns have been fully disclosed in this document. To Humaniq&rsquo;s best. knowledge, the risks have been fully disclosed, but Humaniq makes no representations that there are not other risks outside of Humaniq&rsquo;s direct control.</p> <p>If you have any further questions regarding this, please email us at <a href=\\\"mailto:admin@humaniq.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">admin@humaniq.com</a></p>"
