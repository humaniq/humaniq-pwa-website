          '<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Humaniq is on a mission to make people’s lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. To do that, we need to make sure your data is secure, and protecting it is one of our most important responsibilities. We’re committed to being transparent about our security practices and helping you understand our approach.</p> <h3>Organizational security</h3> <p>Humaniq’s personnel practices apply to all members of the Humaniq workforce (“workers”)—regular employees and independent contractors—who have direct access to Humaniq’s internal information systems (“systems”) and / or unescorted access to Humaniq’s office space. All workers are required to understand and follow internal policies and standards.</p> <p>Before gaining initial access to systems, all workers must agree to confidentiality terms, pass a background screening, and attend security training. This training covers privacy and security topics, including device security, acceptable use, preventing malware, physical security, data privacy, account management, and incident reporting.</p> <p>Upon termination of work at Humaniq, all access to Humaniq systems is removed immediately.</p> <h3>Security and privacy training</h3> <p>During their tenure, all workers are required to complete a refresh of privacy and security training at least annually. They are also required to acknowledge that they’ve read and will follow Humaniq’s information security policies at least annually. Some workers, such as engineers, operators and support personnel who may have elevated access to systems or data, will receive additional job-specific training on privacy and security. Workers are required to report security and privacy issues to appropriate internal teams. Workers are informed that failure to comply with acknowledged policies may result in consequences, up to and including termination.</p> <h3>Dedicated security professionals</h3> <p>Humaniq has defened roles and responsibilities to delineate which roles in the organization are responsible for operating the various aspects of our Information Security Management System (ISMS). The responsibilities of each role are detailed in Humaniq’s security documents.</p> <p>At the centre of administering our ISMS is Humaniq’s Security Team. Humaniq has appointed a Chief Security Officer (CSO) with overall responsibility for the implementation and management of our ISMS. The CSO is supported by the other members of Humaniq’s Security Team, which currently consists of over a dozen security professionals with more than 100 years of combined experience, focusing on Product Security, Security Operations, Computer Security Incident Response, and Risk and Compliance.</p><p>Together, these teams divide responsibilities for key aspects of Humaniq’s security programme, as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Product Security <ul> <li>Establish secure development practices and standards</li> <li>Ensure project-level security risk assessments</li> <li>Provide design review and code review security services for detection and removal of common security aws</li> <li>Train developers on secure coding practices</li> </ul> </li> <li>Security Operations <ul> <li>Build and operate security-critical infrastructure including Humaniq’s public key infrastructure, event monitoring, and authentication services</li> <li>Maintain a secure archive of security-relevant logs</li> <li>Consult with operations personnel to ensure the secure configuration and maintenance of Humaniq’s production environment </li> </ul> </li> <li>CSIRT <ul> <li>Respond to alerts related to security events on Humaniq systems</li> <li>Manage security incidents</li> <li>Acquire and analyze threat intelligence</li> </ul> </li> <li>Risk and Compliance <ul> <li>Coordinate penetration testing</li> <li>Manage vulnerability scanning and remediation</li> <li>Coordinate regular risk assessments, and define and track risk treatment</li> <li>Coordinate audit and maintain security certifications</li> <li>Respond to customer enquiries</li> <li>Review and qualify vendor security posture</li> </ul> </li> </ul>' +
          // '<p>All members of Humaniq’s Security Team are active participants in the larger information security community to improve the overall state of the art of information security and to maintain their own expertise. </p> <h3>Policies and standards</h3> <p>Humaniq maintains a set of policies, standards, procedures and guidelines (“security documents”) that provide the Humaniq workforce with the “rules of the road” for operating Humaniq’s ISMS. Our security documents help ensure that Humaniq customers can rely on our workers to behave ethically and for our service to operate securely. Security documents include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li> Fair, ethical, and legal standards of business conduct</li> <li> Acceptable uses of information systems</li> <li> Classification, labeling, and handling rules for all types of information assets</li> <li> Practices for worker identification, authentication, and authorization for access to system data</li> <li> Secure development, acquisition, configuration, and maintenance of systems</li> <li> Workforce requirements for transitions, training, and compliance with ISMS policies</li> <li> Use of encryption</li> <li> Description, schedule, and requirements for retention of security records</li> <li> Planning for business continuity and disaster recovery</li> <li> Classification and management of security incidents</li> <li> Control of changes</li> <li> Regular use of security assessments such as risk assessments, audits, and penetration tests</li> <li> Use of service organizations</li> </ul> <p>These policies are living documents: they are regularly reviewed and updated as needed, and made available to all workers to whom they apply.</p> <h3>Audits</h3> <p>Humaniq evaluates the design and operation of its overall ISMS for compliance with internal and external standards. Humaniq engages certified assessors to perform external audits at least once per year. Audit results are shared with senior management and all findings are tracked to resolution. </p> <h3>Penetration testing</h3> <p>Humaniq engages independent entities to conduct regular application-level and infrastructure-level penetration tests. Results of these tests are shared with Humaniq management. Humaniq’s Security Team reviews and prioritizes the reported findings and tracks them to resolution. Customers wishing to conduct their own penetration test of Humaniq application may request to do so and should contact their account representative to obtain permission from both Humaniq and Humaniq’s hosting provider. </p> <h3>Legal compliance</h3> <p>Humaniq operates a comprehensive information security programme designed to address the vast majority of the requirements of common security standards. Please contact Humaniq Support, for more information about the security standards with which Humaniq complies and to request copies of available reports and certifications.</p> <h2>Secure by design</h2> <p>Humaniq operates a comprehensive information security programme designed to address the vast majority of the requirements of common security standards. Please contact Humaniq Support, for more information about the security standards with which Humaniq complies and to request copies of available reports and certifications.</p> <h3>SDL</h3> <p>Humaniq assesses the security risk of each software development project according to our Secure Development Lifecycle. Before completion of the design phase, Humaniq undertakes an assessment to qualify the security risk of the software changes introduced. This risk analysis leverages both the OWASP Top 10 and the experience of Humaniq’s Product Security team to categorize every project as High, Medium, or Low risk. Based on this analysis, Humaniq creates a set of requirements that must be met before the resulting change may be released to production.</p> <h2>Protecting customer data</h2> <p>The focus of Humaniq’s security programme is to prevent unauthorized access to customer data. To this end, our team of dedicated security practitioners, working in partnership with peers across all our teams, take exhaustive steps to identify and mitigate risks, implement best practices, and constantly evaluate ways to improve.</p> <h3>Data encryption in transit and stored in </h3> <p>Humaniq transmits data over public networks using strong encryption. This includes data transmitted between Humaniq clients and the Humaniq service. Humaniq supports the latest recommended secure cipher suites to encrypt all traf c in transit, including use of TLS 1.2 protocols, AES256 encryption, and SHA2 signatures, as supported by the clients. Humaniq monitors the changing cryptographic landscape and upgrades the cipher suite choices as the landscape changes, while also balancing the need for compatibility with older clients.</p> <p>Data stored in in Humaniq’s production network is encrypted using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption standards. This applies to all types of data stored within Humaniq’s systems—relational databases, restores, database backups, etc. Humaniq stores encryption keys in a secure server on a segregated network with very limited access. Keys are never stored on the local lesystem, but are delivered at process start time and retained only in memory while in use.</p> <p>The Humaniq service is hosted in data centres maintained by industry-leading service providers. Data centre providers offer state-of-the-art physical protection for the servers and related infrastructure that comprise the operating environment for the Humaniq service. These service providers are responsible for restricting physical access to Humaniq’s systems to authorized personnel.</p> <p>Each Humaniq customer’s data is hosted in Humaniq’s shared infrastructure and segregated logically by the Humaniq application. Humaniq uses a combination of storage technologies to ensure customer data is protected from hardware failures and returns quickly when requested. Network security</p> <p>Humaniq divides its systems into separate networks to better protect more sensitive data. Systems supporting testing and development activities are hosted in a separate network from systems supporting Humaniq’s production website. Customer data submitted into Humaniq services is only permitted to exist in Humaniq’s production network, its most tightly controlled network. Administrative access to systems within the production network is limited to those engineers with a specific business need.</p> <p>Network access to Humaniq’s production environment from open, public networks (the internet) is restricted. Only a small number of production servers are accessible from the internet. Only those network protocols essential for delivery of Humaniq’s service to its users are open at Humaniq’s perimeter. Humaniq deploys mitigations against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at its network perimeter. Changes to Humaniq’s production network configuration are restricted to authorized personnel.</p> <p>In Humaniq’s hosted production environment, control of network devices is retained by the hosting provider. For that reason, Intrusion Detection / Intrusion Prevention (IDS/IPS) are performed using host-based controls. For example, Humaniq logs, monitors, and audits system calls and has developed alerts for system calls that indicate a potential intrusion. Authorizing access</p> <p>To minimize the risk of data exposure, Humaniq adheres to the principle of least privilege—workers are only authorized to access data that they reasonably must handle in order to fulfill their current job responsibilities. To ensure that users are so restricted, Humaniq employs the following measures:</p> <ul> <li>All systems used at Humaniq require users to authenticate, and users are granted unique identi ers for that purpose.</li> <li>Each user’s access is reviewed at least quarterly to ensure the access granted is still appropriate for the user’s current job responsibilities. Workers may be granted access to a small number of internal systems, such as the corporate Humaniq instance, by default upon hire. Requests for additional access follow a documented process and are approved by the responsible owner or manager.</li> </ul> <h3>Authentication</h3> <p>To further reduce the risk of unauthorized access to data, Humaniq employs multi-factor authentication for administrative access to systems with more highly classified data. Where possible and appropriate, Humaniq uses private keys for authentication. For example, at this time, administrative access to production servers requires operators to connect using both an SSH key and a one-time password associated with a device-specific token. Where passwords are used, multi-factor authentication is enabled for access to higher data classifications. The passwords themselves are required to be complex (auto-generated to ensure uniqueness, longer than 12 characters, and not consisting of a single dictionary word, among other requirements). </p> <p>Humaniq requires personnel to use an approved password manager. Password managers generate, store and enter unique and complex passwords. Use of a password manager helps avoid password reuse, phishing, and other behaviors that can reduce security. </p> <h3>System monitoring, logging, and alerting</h3> <p> Humaniq monitors servers, workstations and mobile devices to retain and analyze a comprehensive view of the security state of its corporate and production infrastructure. Administrative access, use of privileged commands, and system calls on all servers in Humaniq’s production network are logged.</p> <p>Humaniq’s Security Team collects and stores production logs for analysis. Logs are stored in a separate network. Access to this network is restricted to members of the Security Team. Logs are protected from modification and retained for at least two years. Analysis of logs is automated to the extent practical to detect potential issues and alert responsible personnel. Alerts are examined and resolved based on documented priorities.</p> <h3>Endpoint monitoring</h3> <p>Humaniq workstations run a variety of monitoring tools that may detect suspicious code or unsafe configurations or user behavior. Humaniq’s Security Team monitors workstation alerts and ensures significant issues are resolved in a timely fashion.</p> <h3>Responding to security incidents</h3> <p>Humaniq has established policies and procedures (also known as runbooks) for responding to potential security incidents. All incidents are managed by Humaniq’s dedicated Computer Security Incident Response Team. Humaniq defines the types of events that must be managed via the incident response process. Incidents are classified by severity. Incident response procedures are tested and updated at least annually.</p> <h3>Workstation security</h3> <p>All workstations issued to workers are configured by Humaniq to comply with our standards for security. These standards require all workstations to be properly configured, kept updated, to run monitoring software, and be tracked by Humaniq&rsquo;s endpoint management solution. Humaniq&rsquo;s default configuration sets up workstations to encrypt data, have strong passwords, and lock when idle. Workstations run up-to-date monitoring software to report potential malware and unauthorized software and mobile storage devices.</p> <h2>Controlling system operations and continuous deployment</h2> <p>We take a variety of steps to combat the introduction of malicious or erroneous code to our operating environment and protect against unauthorized access.</p>' +

Humaniq applies change control requirements to systems that store data at higher levels of sensitivity. These requirements are designed to ensure that changes potentially impacting Customer Data are documented, tested, and approved before deployment.</p> <h3>Prevention and detection of malicious code</h3> <p>In addition to general change control procedures that apply to our systems, Humaniq&rsquo;s production network is subject to additional safeguards against malware.</p> <h3>Server protecting</h3> <p>New servers deployed to production are protected by disabling unneeded and potentially insecure services, removing default passwords, and applying Humaniq&rsquo;s custom configuration settings to each server before use.</p> <h3>File change management</h3><p>Humaniq maintains the configuration of its production servers by using a configuration management system (CMS) that runs frequently to check that only the authorized version of key les are deployed. This CMS will overwrite files found on servers that don&rsquo;t match the correct version stored in a change controlled repository.</p> <h2>Disaster recovery and business continuity</h2> <p>Humaniq utilizes services provided by its hosting provider to distribute its production operation across four separate physical locations. These four locations are within multiple geographic region, and protect Humaniq&rsquo;s service from loss of connectivity, power infrastructure and other common location-specific failures. Production transactions are replicated among these discrete operating environments, to protect the availability of Humaniq&rsquo;s service in the event of a location-specific catastrophic event. Humaniq also retains a full backup copy of production data in a remote location more than 2500 miles from the location of the primary operating environment. Full backups are saved to this remote location once per day and transactions are saved continuously. Humaniq tests backups at least quarterly to ensure they can be correctly restored.</p> <h2>3rd party suppliers</h2> <p>To run its business efficiently, Humaniq relies on sub-contractor organizations. Where those sub-contractor organizations may impact the security of Humaniq&rsquo;s production environment, Humaniq takes appropriate steps to ensure its security posture is maintained. Humaniq establishes agreements that require service organizations to adhere to confidentiality commitments Humaniq has made to its users. Humaniq monitors the effective operation of the organization&rsquo;s safeguards by conducting reviews of its service organization controls before use and at least annually.</p>',
