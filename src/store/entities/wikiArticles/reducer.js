        article: "<p>Banking with Humaniq is simple and secure. The first time that you use the Humaniq app, you authenticate your identity so that you never need any passwords or documentation to access your account. Our face recognition technology will confirm your identity and keep your transactions secure. You are then issued with HMQ, Humaniq coins, for passing bio-identification, so you can immediately get started.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/humaniq_media/7U7LeuHRmj1z2hZzbIU62d\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>You gain more HMQ for engaging with the app, for example by recommending friends and by making transactions. The more people you know who use the app, the more powerful the app becomes. HMQ enables a peer-to-peer economy. One of the main functions is sending or receiving HMQ directly to other users of the app instantly and at virtually zero-cost - making sending sums smaller than $10 without losing money possible for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>We are also talking to major shopping franchises in the markets we are targeting about making HMQ a payment option. And we are working to provide the infrastructure necessary to exchange cryptocurrency for local currency.</p>\r\n<p>We will also be adding further services over time. The plan is that you will be able to use the app to access micro-finance lenders for small loans in a &lsquo;Borrow&rsquo; tab, and even employment in the &lsquo;Earn&rsquo; tab, where on-line, paid tasks are collected and available for you to perform. Humaniq is a bank that pays.</p>",

Our code of conduct underpins our hopes. We would like it to be honoured by everybody joining and taking part in Humaniq.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Communicate and share.</strong> Humaniq can achieve our mission of bringing banking to the unbanked if we are aware of what is working well and what is working less well. Successes help us to show users, partners and investors potential uses and impacts of the Humaniq app and the HMQ tokens, knowledge that helps us to achieve our aims. And constructive criticism helps us to change things so that we can better serve all those currently shut out of opportunities to progress. The Humaniq team will also be as open as we can.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Respect others.</strong> Everybody matters and everybody has ideas and needs to be heard. We want to encourage feedback and suggestions in our community as Humaniq grows. We can all help to do this by being respectful of others and what they have to say. A peer-to-peer economy both tears down old ways of doing things and makes individual respect more important. And a community where everybody feels comfortable to express themselves and to contribute is a community that will learn, strengthen and flourish.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Collaborate</strong>. The beauty of the Humaniq app is that it underpins peer-to-peer collaboration. This allows partnerships between the many, and active participants rather than service user relationships people have with traditional banking institutions. This requires you all to pour your energies into this new way of working. So whether you are a Humaniq app user or a developer, we invite you to enter into the spirit of this new way of creating value and building an economy. The Humaniq team will respond positively. We want to facilitate peer-to-peer lending, partnership and support and to foster the provision of new services delivered by others through our app.</li>\r\n</ol>",

        title: "FAQ",
        article: "<p><strong>How is Humaniq different? Aren&rsquo;t you just another mobile wallet?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Humaniq is a cryptocurrency unlike any other. We are working to put currency into the hands of the 2bn unbanked people. The barriers to use are low, with voice and face recognition technologies used so that the uneducated and the undocumented can access the app and open an account.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It sounds accessible. But is this enough to succeed in putting cryptocurrency into the hands of the many?</strong></p>\r\n<p>With Humaniq, everybody can mint coins. Unlike with other cryptocurrencies, it is not about being the first to own the coins, or having access to specialised hardware or spending a lot on electricity. Everybody, once they have used their face to pass authentication, is rewarded with HMQ. Then, when they interact with the app, they earn more. The minting of coins will continue until we have 2 billion users.</p>\r\n<p><strong>But wasn&rsquo;t other cryptocurrency also aimed at developing countries?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Other crypto also uses Ethereum&rsquo;s custom-built Blockchain to provide new, safe and secure, currency. But it is not used in unbanked regions because it is limited in supply, because of relative usage complexity, and because it is not promoted. The transaction capacity limit of Bitcoin is 250 thousand, compared to PayPal&rsquo;s 100 million active accounts. We have researched the markets we are targeting, and recruited dozens of prominent bitcoiners living in developing countries to our Humaniq Ambassador Program. They are teaching people how to use Humaniq - and earn cryptocurrency for that.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why use the Blockchain to make payments?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Blockchain is a decentralised way of confirming transactions that steps into the breach that has been created by centralised banks not serving 2 billion people around the world. The Blockchain allows payments to be checked and confirmed so there can be no double payments or lost payments, without there being a centralised authority. This technology therefore underpins an expansion of banking services to those currently shut out from the digital economy because of the existing banking infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why the Ethereum Blockchain?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Humaniq app runs on the Ethereum platform, which is a way of running Blockchain-based, decentralised apps without unnecessary complexity and risk entailed in deploying a new Blockchain. The Ethereum Blockchain, which was first launched in the summer of 2015, is a well-established platform to provide secure banking without a central server. Using a ready and operating Blockchain allowed us to create a solution to the need for security for transactions quickly, without needless expenditure or loss of quality. This allows us to put more time and energy into concentrating on what matters most: our people-focused business model.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why invest in Humaniq?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are pleased that so many people responded so positively to our Initial Coin Offering. Nearly 12,000 people have bought HMQ cryptocurrency because they believe in our vision to provide banking to the unbanked. Humaniq has been highlighted as in the top ten per cent of cryptocurrencies by value, with a market valuation of over $5m, and our ICO as one of the most successful in the last two years. Our vision will make HMQ the de facto currency for developing countries, the oil that runs the engines of their economies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why did you hold an ICO?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We already had access to capital for our project but we believe it is fair to allow everybody to invest and to participate in Humaniq. We also wanted to help build our community and to have an opportunity to tell the story of Humaniq to more people in the media. Our belief that many would want to be involved and to support and help steer Humaniq proved well-founded: nearly 12,000 participated in the ICO held in April 2017 after reading our white paper. Our strategy&nbsp;is to focus on the massive potential of providing banking to the unbanked.</p>",

There were in total 11,600 participants who made an average contribution of $430, raising $5.1m for the project. Each participant was able to buy 1,000 HMQ tokens or more. The majority of those supporting our vision and joining our community were motivated by our strategy and the huge untapped potential market of the 2bn unbanked people in the world.</p>\r\n<p>The HMQ tokens were then released on the 5th May, with a fifth issued for the HMQ team, including to invest in business development and marketing. Following the ICO, Humaniq has appeared on the following exchanges:Bittrex, Liqui, &nbsp;Yobit, C-CEX.

This series will cover all of the core concepts in short and easy-to-understand snippets.</p>\r\n<p>At its core, a blockchain is simply a ledger of transactions, which by itself is nothing ground-breaking. However, traditional forms of storage are completely centralized: when you put your money in a bank, for example, you are trusting it to store it safely for you. Its databases could be hacked, and no one would be able to notice it, except for the bank itself.</p>\r\n<p>Blockchain operates under the principle of decentralized and &ldquo;trustless&rdquo; storage. The integrity of the data is guaranteed by cryptography and math, which is verifiable by anyone. This is what trustless means: instead of trusting any single entity, like a bank, you rely on cryptographic rules that guarantee the safety of the data.</p>\r\n<p>However, it is useful to understand exactly what are these rules, and how blockchain achieves its goal of being tamper-proof.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/humaniq_media/7U7LeuHRmj1z2hZzbIU6FX\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%;\" /></p>",

To make the system work, the transactions must be grouped into single chunks called &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;, hence the term &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo;. Every block has its own unique hash identifier as well, but more on that later.</p>\r\n<p>A block must have something called a &ldquo;block header&rdquo;, a set of values representing its properties.

This hash is a unique representation of all of the transactions inside the block, and even the tiniest alteration in one of the components would produce a completely different Merkle Root.</p>\r\n<p>The Merkle root is then added together with the hash identifier of the previous block (and several other values) to create a new hash string: the identifier of the new block. Thus, every single block directly depends on the previous one, forming a chain.</p>\r\n<p></p>",

They take even more in some areas - twice as much in South Africa. Banks issuing payment cards take around 50 cents of your money when you sell something for $20. And interest on loans can be even more: to borrow 5,000 Kenyan Shillings, you can pay 1,800 Kenyan Shillings!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you want to send, charge or borrow money, how can you keep more of it?

It is a shared, decentralised database run by a peer-to-peer network of computers or nodes, as opposed to the central server that runs traditional applications and websites. Every request to make a transaction, such as when one person agrees to lend money to another who wishes to borrow, is information that is distributed across this network, not stored in one place. The result is a permanent, incorruptible and secure record of each and every transaction, stored across the network publically and chronologically on what is referred to as a &lsquo;digital ledger&rsquo; in &lsquo;blocks&rsquo; of data.</p>",

In order to achieve this, each person who offers their hardware and storage space for the purpose of sustaining the blockchain is rewarded with cryptocurrency.

It also means that HMQ are easily exchangeable with other cryptocurrency tokens that follow the ERC20 rules, including Ether, the Ethereum token. Humaniq is still young: our ICO (initial coin offer) was only held in April 2017 and the Humaniq app launch is scheduled for August.

Other providers have since launched other blockchains in order to cater for such wider applications, including Ethereum, which in 2016 launched a new, open-source, blockchain as a platform for any applications that cut out middle-men and widen access to services..

It also opens up the possibility of a new, peer-to-peer, sharing economy, where people can directly send and receive, lend and borrow money to and from each other, rather than relying on financial industry and its fee-charging field representatives.
