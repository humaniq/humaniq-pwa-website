# Humaniq Website v2.0

Do not merge me!!! For test only!

Humaniq is a simple and secure 4th generation mobile banking app, based on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) technologies. Safe and strong, this tool of financial inclusion connects 2 billion unbanked people to the global economy. 

Our new version of the website is built on the [PWA technology](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) to provide our users an ability to safely search the website without any internet connection. 

## Features

Current website provides following functionality:

* Wiki — Humaniq collects a huge knowledge base, indexes it and exposes to the public, for everyone's view. 
* Blockchain Explorer — Humaniq has implemented our own blockchain explorer, that allows everyone to watch HMQ token live and in action.
